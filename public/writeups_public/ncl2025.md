> Was a pretty good NCL season for me, personally I got 23rd which was lower than what I was hoping to get and my team got 4th. I was playing on a 4 year old laptop with pretty crappy specs this time around so I am still pretty happy with the result.

# Individual Game 
One thing that really bit me in the individual game is I spent a long time playing around and working on my password cracking tooling for leeting (based on the practice game and previous seasons). Of course, per my luck there were no password crackings of that style this time around.
