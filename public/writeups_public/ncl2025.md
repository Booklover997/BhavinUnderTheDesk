> Was a pretty good NCL season for me, personally I got 23rd which was lower than what I was hoping to get and my team got 4th. I was playing on a 4 year old laptop with pretty crappy specs this time around so I am still pretty happy with the result.

# Individual Game 
One thing that really bit me in the individual game is I spent a long time playing around and working on my password cracking tooling for leeting (based on the practice game and previous seasons). Of course, per my luck there were no password cracklings of that style this time around. I think being extra careful this time gave me a huge accuracy bump to 94%.  

I fell short in the web hard this time around after getting distracted trying to find a .toString vulnerability in the json after finding that it calls .toString. However, the issue with this is that there is no way to get RCE for the local file inclusion this way which is why I thought it would end up being a misuse of some sort of deserializer like a node serializer which allows the serialization of functions.

# Team Game
This is the juicy part where I will try not to rant too much. This time around my teammates wanted to use a google sheets to keep track of answers which was in my opinion much better than the alternatives I've used in the past such as discord threads and group management websites like Trello and Monday.com.

We had the fun experience of locking ourselves in a computer lab room to work for hours each day (we were thinking so hard our building sprung a water leak the last 3 hours).

I enjoyed the mainframe challenges (Mili my goat did most of them I was just shoulder surfing). However, we didn't BYU it and as a result our accuracy got tanked by 3 questions we could have certainly gotten if we were more thorough. Our issues came out to three main parts.

## Submitting Too Quickly
A lot of people on the team hadn't done NCL in a while or at all before so that led to a lot of early incorrect submissions. 

## Not Independent Checking
We "happy incidents" where multiple people got the same answer, didn't feel like typing it out, and agreed on the same incorrectly spelt URL. This was also the case for one of the log challenges where one of us got a log file missing a person, and we all conveniently decided to use the same one 😅.

## Not fully Validating 
A lot of times we would also just full send it, which perchance may have been my fault (I've been playing a lot of into the breach lately it does that to you). This is definitely an issue especially when it is super checkable, for instance how would you run a program on the main frame. 

## Funny Password Cracking Moments
I won't rant about the pw cracking hard challenge yet, but we did have some really funny moments near the end during the last three hours trying to crack our semi-uncrackable hash.

Specifically it was for the category called "Wyrmguard Bank". We thought we had a general map that it was something like theme -> something to do with that theme. 
```json
Dormitories -> Actual Dormitory Password 
Howler Hub -> Actual Person
Pensiever -> Potion Ingredient (Small magical basin) 
Spellbook -> Name of Spellbook
```
This led to us coming up with some pretty good, if a little wonky, guesses. Wyrm is used to indicate a type of dragon which obviously is a reference to how Gringott's bank is a reference to dragons. This led us to thinking there was obviously some dragon that we had missed and a lot of reading about dragons.

Our next guess was less reasonable. We thought it might have something to do with the Gemino and Flagrante curses put on the Lestrange Vault. The thought process was that similar to a password, the curses are also there to protect. Of course the password was 15 characters long so we tried variations of them combined. 

Our third guess required a couple jumps. First if you've played Hollow Knight, a wyrm can be a giant literal worm like creature. Is there perhaps, a giant literal worm like creature in harry potter. That's right the Basilisk. My team member who came up with this was cooking, maybe a little bit too much.

# Password Crack Drama
Of course, the 4th question for password cracking was thrown out due to a full typo, however, even without the typo, `Madampuddifoot's` was by far a much harder base than the others as even the harry potter literature switches between calling it Madam Puddifoot's and Madam Puddifoot's  teashop. There were also special characters within the seed words which for some reason were not counted towards the total character count. Some of the seed words once again did not have these.

```json
Eyelopsowlemporium <- eeylopsowlemporium ( double misspelled)
Wiseacre'swizardingequipment <- why is there an apostrophe here?
Gladragswizardwear <- why is there not an apostrophere here?
Madampuddifoot's <- why is this trunucated (Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop) 
Potage'scauldronshop <- apostrophe again
```

In the future I would like to see the same password **seed** for all players with different password hashes generated via added numbers or symbols. It's not very fun when others have significantly easier hashes than you. 
# Conclusion
Although I'm angry about our password hash being more difficult, at the end of the day it is still a skill issue.  BYU did have Madampuddifoot's in their wordlist as it does appear in some areas just not the fandom which is what we scraped. Overall, was still a good time and I look forwarding to running it back in Spring.
